# 2019.02.01

I'm officially starting to work on this project with Dominique and Juliette. I'm downloading the `Ford` folder so that I'll be able to work with its content locally without using the shared folder hosted on Dropbox. Our last meeting with Juliette was super interesting and we had a bunch of promising ideas to kickoff the project. Before starting to code or design with something in mind, I'ld like therefore to take some time to map out what's being done these days at the intersection between `language x archive x programming`. I'll also take some time to sum up our first brainstorming session later.

------

This project is directly embeded into a `research through design`  approach, so the idea is to use a body of 'wickedly' suitable methods along the project, such as this digital diary (Coming from Barr, Khaled and Lessard's MDMA proposition), as well as case studies of other projects involving language and code. Along the project, I'll also quickly prototype ideas and ways language could be manipulated using code. 

Ideally, these informal logs could provide us interesting insights about what was intended behind the project's (final) forms. These logs could help us to therefore track the trajectories taken (or aborted) along the project.

------

Let's kickoff the research by interesting projects coming from artists, researchers, designers, programmers and playing with language and its frictions with the machine. These projects will resonate with the franklin-ford-bot project.

1. David (Jhave) Johnston:

   1. [ReRites](http://glia.ca/rerites/). This project is amazing. It's basically a neural networks (aka artificial intelligence) trained on a contemporary poetry corpus that recreates poetry.

      What I like with this project is the idea of an artificial agency, making its own decisions based on a human input. At the base-level of the franklin-ford-bot, there's an `OCR script` converting images to readable (by a machine) text (called: string).  These `OCR` is already an artificial/machinic agency; and it could be interesting to extend this agency further.

2. Alyson Parish has inspiring projects:

   1. [semantic_similarity_chatbot](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/114dd7018134c5da80bae0a101866581) is a chatbot that mimics someone's writing style "â€”a famous author, a historical figure, or even the student's own e-mails or messaging logs.". 
   2. She's also playing a lot with [compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meovx9OqWJc) to create new form of textual poetic approaches and translations. This is quite interesting and there's parrallels we could create with the OCR program we're using to translate images to text (based on certain compression parameters). More on that soon.
   3. Finally, she's working with this idea of [semantic space](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/semantic-space-literal-robots/), which is also quite interesting because it gives a way to approch textual entities (such as the ones we have for the project) as spaces with their own maps and trajectories. With this technique, words (or sentences) could be therefore associated based on a variety of parameters inputed by users. (Key)words could be then filtered based on specific options. I know it's quite abstract but we'll have some time to experiment with this.
