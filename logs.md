# 2019.02.01+ 2019.02.04

I'm officially starting to work on this project with Dominique and Juliette. I'm downloading the `Ford` folder so that I'll be able to work with its content locally without using the shared folder hosted on Dropbox. Our last meeting with Juliette was super interesting and we had a bunch of promising ideas to kickoff the project. Before starting to code or design with something in mind, I'ld like therefore to take some time to map out what's being done these days at the intersection between `language x archive x programming`. I'll also take some time to sum up our first brainstorming session later.

------

This project is directly embeded into a `research through design`  approach, so the idea is to use a body of 'wickedly' suitable methods along the project, such as this digital diary format (Coming from Barr, Khaled and Lessard's MDMA proposition), as well as case studies of other projects involving language and code. Along the project, I'll also quickly prototype ideas and explore through code forms how language could be manipulated and rendered using code. 

Ideally, these informal logs will provide us interesting insights about what was intended behind the project's (final) forms. These logs will therefore help us to track and analyze the trajectories taken (or aborted) along the project.

------

Let's kickoff the research by interesting projects coming from artists, researchers, designers, programmers - and playing with language and its frictions inside machinic contexts. These projects will resonate with the franklin-ford-bot project and I'll use case studies and other examples coming from what's being done today to reframe the project and place it inside a broader research context.

1. David (Jhave) Johnston:

   1. [ReRites](http://glia.ca/rerites/). This project is amazing. It's basically a neural networks (aka artificial intelligence) trained on a contemporary poetry corpus that recreates poetry.

      What I like with this project is the idea of artificial agency, making its own decisions based on a human input. 

2. Alyson Parish has inspiring projects:

   1. [semantic_similarity_chatbot](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/114dd7018134c5da80bae0a101866581) is a chatbot that mimics someone's writing style "â€”a famous author, a historical figure, or even the student's own e-mails or messaging logs.". 
   2. She's also playing a lot with [compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meovx9OqWJc) to create new form of textual poetic approaches and translations. This is quite interesting and there's parrallels we could create with the OCR program we're using to translate images to text (based on certain compression parameters). More on that soon.
   3. Finally, Parrish is working with this idea of [semantic space](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/semantic-space-literal-robots/), which is also quite interesting because it gives a way to approch textual entities (such as the ones we have for the project) as spaces with their own maps and dynamics. With this technique, words (or sentences) could be associated based on a variety of parameters inputed by users. (Key)words could be then filtered based on specific options and new kinds of dynamic associations could be created. For now, it's quite abstract but we'll have some time to experiment with this.

3. There's also a bunch of very interesting small projects (bots && || poems ) coming from artists, poets and researchers working with language:

   1. Darius Kazemi: http://tinysubversions.com/
   2. Nick Montfort: https://nickm.com/
   3. This fun bot by Callum Copley: https://twitter.com/starterpackbot

On top of the bots that we're going to create, there's also a website that will be used as the main host for these things to be shown and explained publically. However, more than a simple website, it could be interested to approach this website not only as a container but as a Platform, as an experience where we'll show these bots dynamically. Drawing on this idea of experience, the website could change based on the user's input or others parameters such as:

- The user's GPS coordinates 
- The date and time
- The user's numbers of visits on the website.
- The user's IP address 
- ...

The main website could redirect to subdomains where different parts of the project will be hosted? The website could take the form of a textual game with specific narratives depending on the user's input?

------

During our first brainstorming session, a number of interesting ideas came up. I'll list these ideas - a.k.a strategies that we could use to embody the Franklin Ford bot and make it more dynamic and playful?

- Creating a timeline where different Tweets will be sorted and grouped.
  - This timeline could be re_ordered based on different filters?

- Creating a chatbot based on content related to the franklin-ford bot?
  - This is a promising idea and I didnt have the chance to create a chatbot yet.
- Playing with AI to create new kinds of computer-generated language based on Ford?
  - This could be easily paired with the chatbot idea. More on this soon.
- Creating a chrome extension?
  - I don't think we talked about this when we met but it's something I had in mind recently. I don't really envision this as a main asset of the project but as a fun exploration on its own. The idea is to give the user of this plugin (that you install on your browser) an updated version of all the webpages he will visit.
    - With chrome extensions, specific (or all) words, images, videos, advertisments (and so on) could be changed. All kinds of contents could be also added inside the webpage. [This one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/santa-to-satan/oggeichdlekdakedbibaihfehgdckdfk), for an example, is replacing the word `santa` by the word `satan`. You get the idea ;-)
    - Chrome extensions could also operate only for a specific website or for lists of websites. 
- As I mentioned earlier, creating an online game? There's some interesting online textual games, like [Burnt Matches](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2016/11/29/burnt-matches/) done by Pippin Barr - [more info here](https://killscreen.com/articles/pippin-barrs-new-game-brings-concrete-poetry-life/).

Now going back to the root files of the project that Juliette and Dominique shared me. I'ld like now to spend some time on:

- [ ] Investigate this idea of remediation, something that also interest me for my thesis' subject on analog transmitting protocols and language flow inside the network. I'll most specifically read the PDF file located in the `/digital journalism` directory: `@franklinfordbot: remediating Franklin Ford`.
- [ ] Go through Ford's "intelligence triangle" and investigate its types of publications in relation to the design ideas we had during our meeting.
- [ ] Go through the collected texts and PDF files located in the `/Textes primaires "clean"`  directory.
- [ ] Go through the ORC
